# Family Archive
## Overview
### Project Name
Family Archive
### Purpose
When finished, this will be a simple website that displays 
family tree data for my family. Website visitors will see the 
data organized as a clickable timeline that will expand and give details
about specific people, events, and more.

This project is an important personal project of mine because I wanted to 
create it to memorialize my parents, who both passed away in 2024.
### Audience
The primary audience will be members of the Morlock and Silva families
who are interested in reading stories about their relatives and ancestors.
## Project Goals
1. Create a fully functional API using FastAPI that implements a relational database.
2. Complete testing to ensure program logic works as intended.
3. Build the front-end of the website with React that will include an admin dashboard for adding data.
4. Deploy to a family domain name and give family members the address.
